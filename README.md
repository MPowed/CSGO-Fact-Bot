# CSGO-Fact-Bot
CSGO bot that types random facts into global chat because why not

Very very basic program that takes a list of random facts and then types it into chat for you. Its not special, just for fun.  

- Step 1: F1 to enable the facts  
- Step 2: Press Y to type, Y is needed to be pressed so we are not "Hacking" the game    


Notes  
- The things_to_say file should be edited to say things before the random fact "~0~" seperates two possible things you could say (i.e "A Random Fact For You")  
- You are welcome to edit the random facts file and add your own. People will ask about them so it is always nice to have SOME information about it  
- The "ready" status of the random facts will time out after 30 seconds to avoid accidently typing random facts when you actually want to type something. Just              start at step 1 again.
