# CSGO-Fact-Bot
CSGO bot that types random facts into global chat because why not

Very very basic program that takes a list of random facts and then types it into chat for you. Its not special, just for fun.  

- Step 1: F1 to turn on the facts bot (ready)
- Step 2: Press Y to have the facts bot type, Y is needed to be pressed so we are not "Hacking" the game    


Notes  
- The things_to_say file should be edited to say things before the random fact "~0~" seperates two possible things you could say (i.e "A Random Fact For You")  
- You are welcome to edit the random facts file and add your own. People will ask about them so it is always nice to have SOME information about it  
- The "ready" status of the random facts will time out after 30 seconds to avoid the bot typing when the user wants to type. When the facts bot is wanted   just start at step 1 again.
